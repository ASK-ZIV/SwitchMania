# SwitchMania
SmartThings SwitchMania-related Apps & Devices

---

SwitchMania - is the parent app.  It controls 2 types of child apps:  

(1) 'My Virtual Switch Creator' - it can now create 4 different types of virtual switches: (i) on/off switches, (ii) momentary switches,       (iii) dimmer switches, and (iv) simulated presence sensors); and
(2) 'My Switch Calls Routines App' - links any switch with a Routine when a switch is turned on or off.

You need to install all 3 apps in the IDE.

You should also install SmartThings' "Momentary Button Tile" and Michael Struck's dimmer switch.  A copy of both of these device handlers can be found in this repo.
